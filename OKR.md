# Quarterly Objectives and Key Results

We try to frame our ongoing work using a process based on quarterly Objectives and Key Results (OKRs). Objectives reflect outcomes that are challenging, but realistic. Results are tangible and measurable.

## 2018 Q3

**The Connectivity Magic story is figured out and solved**

- A js-ipfs Daemon will always find other IPFS Daemons (js & go) in the LAN 
- The rendezvous protocol is a sound solution for DApps (e.g. PeerPad & others)
- The DHT is enabled by default in js-ipfs
- Handles correctly a scenario where the number of Connections grows (through Conn Management Strategy)
- ... MOAR :D

**Daemon is as reliable as it can be**

- A Daemon runs for 10 days without a crash
- One or more js-ipfs daemons are part of the Bootsrapper nodes 
- js-ipfs can handle 1TB of data, both Node.js and Browser.
- npm on IPFS over js-ipfs is a sound way to install deps and gets used for CI
- ... MOAR :D

**New user/contributor experience is extraordinary**
- js.ipfs.io is finished and published
- ... MOAR :D

Once these OKRs are finished, you will be able to find them on the [2018 Q3 IPFS OKRs Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19vjigg4locq4fO6JXyobS2yTx-k-fSzlFM5ngZDPDbQ/edit#gid=274358435)
